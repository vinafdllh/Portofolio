### About Me üëã
Hi, my name is Vina. Since the beginning of 2022, I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to have finally found a field in which I can successfully grow. As an Information Systems graduate, I am highly motivated, organized, and detail-oriented, which enables me to deliver high-quality work. In a QA role, I see the potential to make the digital world more welcoming for everyone.
In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase the practical skills I have gained through courses, self-study, and my job. I am determined to continue growing in this field, and my main focus right now is on further expanding my knowledge and hands-on experience

### My experience üè¢
Being a Software Quality Assurance professional at PT Kode Inovasi Teknologi (CODR) is my first professional position in the QA field. I have experienced significant growth in both my technical and soft skills, such as developing strong analytical thinking and gaining expertise in test case documentation. In addition, during my previous role as a QA intern at PT Pegadaian, one of my responsibilities was to oversee the proper functioning of the internal system and report any bugs or defects to the QA Lead. I have grown very fond of this role, which has further strengthened my interest in pursuing a career in QA.
